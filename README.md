- 👋 Hi, I’m Toby. I build and optimise Talent & People operations, and find start/scale-ups especially exciting and rewarding to build.
- 👀 I’m interested in Talent & People, and the effect that effective strategies across both can have on company performance and team culture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the absolute compleate square 1 basics of Python - spoiler: I've never learnt any coding before in my life!
- 💞️ I’m registered as a mentor at lollipop mentoring http://www.lollipopmentoring.com/; and myGwork https://www.mygwork.com/
- 📫 How to reach me ------> Connect with me on LinkedIn and say hello! https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobykanetsuka/
